# Safe Project Sharing for WildBranch

## Secure Sharing Method (Recommended)

### Step 1: Clean Export
1. Download your project as ZIP from Replit (⋯ menu → Download as ZIP)
2. Extract and remove sensitive files before sharing:
   - Delete `node_modules/` folder (can be reinstalled)
   - Remove `.env` files (if any)
   - Delete `cookies.txt`
   - Remove any files in `attached_assets/` with personal screenshots

### Step 2: Create Documentation Package
Include these files for context:
- `QUICK_SHARE.md` (already created)
- `replit.md` (your project documentation)
- `package.json` (shows dependencies)
- `shared/schema.ts` (database structure)
- Key source files: `client/src/`, `server/`, `shared/`

### Step 3: What's Safe to Share
✅ All your TypeScript/JavaScript code
✅ Configuration files (tailwind.config.ts, vite.config.ts)
✅ Database schema and types
✅ Component and page code
✅ Documentation files

### What to NEVER Share
❌ Environment variables or secrets
❌ Database connection strings
❌ API keys (Stripe, authentication secrets)
❌ User data or session information
❌ Personal screenshots with identifying info

## Alternative: Private Documentation Only

Instead of sharing code, you could share just:
1. `QUICK_SHARE.md` - Project overview and context
2. `replit.md` - Your preferences and architecture
3. Database schema from `shared/schema.ts`
4. Specific code snippets you need help with

This gives AI assistants enough context to help without exposing your full codebase.

## Security Notes
- Your actual secrets (DATABASE_URL, STRIPE_SECRET_KEY) are stored in Replit's secure environment
- They're not in your code files, so they won't be in any download
- Your database data stays on Replit's servers
- Authentication is handled by Replit's systems

You have complete control over what gets shared.
