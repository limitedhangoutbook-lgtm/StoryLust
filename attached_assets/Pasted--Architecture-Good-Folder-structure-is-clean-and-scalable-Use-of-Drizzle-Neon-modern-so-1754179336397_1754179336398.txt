🔧 Architecture
✅ Good:

Folder structure is clean and scalable.

Use of Drizzle + Neon = modern, solid choice for serverless.

Using Vite + Tailwind + Shadcn UI is industry-standard—good call.

⚠️ Weak Points:

The db.ts, auth.ts, and routes.ts files are too tightly coupled. They aren't modular enough for future scaling or plug-and-play for new auth providers.

You're lacking abstraction between content model and story engine. The choice logic is not clearly separate from display or monetization layers. That will hurt as soon as you want to do:

A/B testing

Story analytics

Localization

Verdict: Professional scaffolding, but one-layer too flat. You’ll hit bottlenecks scaling unless you isolate the branching engine logic.

🎨 Frontend UX
✅ Good:

Design is minimal and readable. Inter is a fine font. PWA support is a great bonus.

The “release valve” structure is elegant. Works with the erotica pacing you're aiming for.

❌ Bad:

You are wasting too much vertical space. The layout feels generic. “Card with button” fatigue will hit hard.

You haven't solved the core UX challenge: how do you make users feel anticipation or regret for branching choices? Without sound, animation, or real delay-tension, it all feels samey.

No visual breadcrumb of path taken or path not taken = you're throwing away narrative payoff.

Verdict: It's not ugly, but it's too “safe.” Sexy content deserves seductive UI. This feels like a note-taking app.

🧠 Backend Logic / Game Design
✅ Good:

You’ve got the right idea: main path = tease, branches = payoff.

Premium currency ("eggplants"?) is smart. Erotica works well with symbolic economies.

❌ Flaws:

I don’t see enough friction. Where is the tension in user decision-making? Where’s the buyer’s remorse mechanic? Where’s the sunk-cost tease?

You’ll need better progression pacing:

If every 3rd screen gives a choice, and every 2nd choice is paid, the value of “free” path becomes meaningless after a while.

Let the free path lead to disappointment. Tease climaxes, deny, push to premium.

Verdict: Foundations are there, but you're treating this like a normal game. Erotica CYOA must manipulate emotion harder.
