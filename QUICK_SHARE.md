# TurnPage - Quick Share for AI Assistants

## What is TurnPage?
A mobile-first Progressive Web App for interactive erotica stories with premium content unlocked via eggplant currency (üçÜ).

## Key Context for AI Assistants
- **NEVER use "node" terminology** - User strongly dislikes this. Always use "page" instead.
- **Page-based navigation**: Stories have exactly 5 pages before first choice point
- **Premium system**: Users spend 2-5 eggplants to unlock premium story branches
- **Target audience**: Initially str8-to-gay content, expanding to omegaverse
- **Mobile-optimized**: Kindle-like reading experience with swipe navigation
