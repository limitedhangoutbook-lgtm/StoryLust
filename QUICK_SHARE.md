# Wild Branch - Quick Share for AI Assistants

## What is Wild Branch?
A mobile-first Progressive Web App for interactive erotica stories with premium content unlocked via eggplant currency (üçÜ).

## Key Context for AI Assistants
- **NEVER use "node" terminology** - User strongly dislikes this. Always use "page" instead.
- **Page-based navigation**: Flexible system - stories can have choice points at any page (current examples use page 5 for testing)
- **Premium system**: Flexible eggplant costs - can be any amount (current examples use 2-5 eggplants)
- **Target audience**: Initially str8-to-gay content, expanding to all genres (not just omegaverse)
- **Mobile-optimized**: Kindle-like reading experience with swipe navigation

‚úÖ Authentication system with Replit OIDC  
‚úÖ 5 complete stories with branching narratives  
‚úÖ Premium choice purchase system
